"When we began this campaign almost a year ago, we started off at 3 percent in the polls. We were about 70 points behind Secretary Clinton. In the last couple of weeks, there were two polls out there that had us ahead.",Sanders,4/14/2016,Democrat
"You know, I have been all over this country, but the truth is, it is great and great to come home and see all my friends.",Sanders,3/1/2016,Democrat
"You know, we want to win in every part of the country, that goes without saying. But it does say something and means so much to me that the people who know me best, the people who knew me before I was elected, who knew me as mayor, knew me as congressman, and know me as senator, have voted so strongly to put us in the White House. Thank you so much.",Sanders,3/1/2016,Democrat
"This campaign — as I think all of you know, this campaign is not just about electing the president. It is about transforming America.",Sanders,3/1/2016,Democrat
"It is about making our great country the nation that we know it has the potential to be.",Sanders,3/1/16,Democrat
"It is about dealing with some unpleasant truths that exist in America today and having the guts to confront those truths.",Sanders,3/1/2016,Democrat
"It is about recognizing that in our state, we have town meetings and people come out, they argue about budgets, and then they vote. One person, one vote.",Sanders,3/1/2016,Democrat
"In Vermont, billionaires do not buy town meetings, and in America, we are going to end a corrupt campaign finance system.",Sanders,3/1/2016,Democrat
"We can disagree in a democracy, and that’s what a democracy is about, but I hope all of us agree that we’re going to not allow billionaires and their super PACs to destroy American democracy.",Sanders,3/1/2016,Democrat
"In our state — in our state, you all know that we have many, many thousands of Vermonters who are working not just one job, they’re working two jobs, they’re working three jobs.",Sanders,3/1/2016,Democrat
"And you all know that while our people are working so hard, almost all of the new wealth and income generated in America is going to the top 1 percent.",Sanders,3/1/2016,Democrat
"Well, together, what we are going to do is create an economy that works for all of us, not just the people on top.",Sanders,3/1/2016,Democrat
"And together, we are going to end and reform a broken criminal justice system.",Sanders,3/1/2016,Democrat
"This country, the wealthiest country in the history of the world, should not be having more people in jail than any other country on earth. That’s wrong.",Sanders,3/1/2016,Democrat
"So we are going to invest for our young people in education, in jobs, not jails or incarceration.",Sanders,3/1/2016,Democrat
"Now, I know many of my Republican colleagues think that climate change is a hoax.",Sanders,3/1/2016,Democrat

"Together, we are going to transform our energy system away from fossil fuel to energy efficiency and sustainable energy.",Sanders,3/1/2016,Democrat

"So let me go on the record and say as you have heard me say for years, health care is a right for all people.",Sanders,3/1/2016,Democrat
"And let me also say that in the United States of America, when we talk about public education, it’s not just first grade through 12th that has got to be expanded to make public colleges and universities tuition-free.",Sanders,3/1/2016,Democrat
"What I have said from day one in this campaign and I suspect many of you were down on the lake with me when we announced on that beautiful day.",Sanders,3/1/2016,Democrat
"What I have said is that this campaign is not just about electing a president. It is about making a political revolution.",Sanders,3/1/2016,Democrat
"What that revolution is about is bringing millions of millions of people into the political process. Working people who have been so disillusioned, they no longer vote. Young people who have never been involved.",Sanders,3/1/2016,Democrat
"What the political revolution is about is bringing our people together. Black and white, Latino, Asian-American.",Sanders,3/1/2016,Democrat
"Gay and straight. People born in America, people who have immigrated to America. When we bring our people together, when we do not allow the Donald Trumps of the world to divide us up.",Sanders,3/1/2016,Democrat
"When we bring our people together and when we have the courage to stand up to the billionaire class and tell them they can’t have it all.",Sanders,3/1/2016,Democrat
"That our government belongs to all of us, not just super PACs and wealthy campaign contributors.",Sanders,3/1/2016,Democrat
"Now, tonight, you’re going to see a lot of election results come in. And let me remind you of what the media often forgets about. These are not — this is not a general election. It is not winner-take-all. If you get 52 percent, you get 48 percent, you roughly end up with the same amount of delegates in a state. By the end of tonight, we are going to win many hundreds of delegates.",Sanders,3/1/2016,Democrat
"Ten months ago, as you know better than any other group in America, when we were out on the lake, we were at 3 percent in the polls. We have come a very long way in 10 months.",Sanders,3/1/2016,Democrat
"At the end of tonight, 15 states will have voted, 35 states remain. And let me assure you that we are going to take our fight for economic justice, for social justice, for environmental sanity, for a world of peace to every one of those states.",Sanders,3/1/2016,Democrat
"Now, Wall Street may be against us and the super PACs may be against us. But you know why we’re going to win? Because our message is resonating and the people when we stand together will be victorious.",Sanders,3/1/2016,Democrat
"So on a personal note, I want to thank all of you for the love and the friendship that you have given our family. You have sustained me.",Sanders,3/1/2016,Democrat
"Well, thank you. You know, I look in the faces of people all across this country, and I know they want to be hopeful. And many are hopeful. Look, I can take conservative policies to the White House, to Washington, to restore the strength of our economy. But I also want to transfer power, money and influence to where you live, because I believe the strength in this country rests in the neighborhoods, the families, the communities and our states.",Kasich,3/15/2016,Republican
"And I believe it's a new partnership - a partnership that can allow us to restore the spirit of America and strengthen America for the best century we've ever had. Thank you.",Kasich,3/15/2016,Republican
"Every election is important. I believe this is the most important election in a generation. Because what's at stake in this election is not simply what party is going to be in charge or which candidate wins. What's at stake is our identity as a nation and as a people.",Rubio,3/15/2016,Republican
"For over two centuries, America has been an exceptional nation. And now the time has come for this generation to do what it must do to keep it that way. If we make the right choice in this election, our children are going to be the freest and most prosperous Americans that have ever lived. And the 21st century is going to be a new American century.",Rubio,3/15/2016,Republican
"Fifty-nine years ago, Florida welcomed my father to America as he stepped off the ferry boat from Cuba onto Key West. He was 18. He was filled with hopes and dreams, and yet he was in the freest land on the face of the earth.",Cruz,3/15/2016,Republican
"This election, this debate is not about insults. It's not about attacks. It's not about any of the individuals on this stage. This election is about you and your children. It's about the freedom America has always had and making sure that that freedom is there for the next generation, that we stop Washington from standing in the way of the hard-working taxpayers of America.",Rubio,3/15/2016,Republican
"Well, Jake, I grew up in a blue collar family. And the simple fact of the matter is that of course we're sensitive about trade. One out of five Americans works in a job connected to trade; 38 million Americans are connected to it.",Kasich,3/15/2016,Republican
"But my position has always been we want to have free trade, but fair trade. And I've been arguing all along that it is absolutely critical that when other countries break those agreements, we don't turn the process over to some international bureaucrat who comes back a couple years later and says, Oh, America was right, and people are out of work.",Kasich,3/15/2016,Republican
"The fact of the matter is we have to have an expedited process. When people cheat, when countries cheat and they take advantage of us, we need to blow the whistle. And as president of the United States, I absolutely will blow the whistle and begin to stand up for the American worker.",Kasich,3/15/2016,Republican
"But we don't want to lock the doors and pull down the blinds and leave the world. Because frankly, if we do that, prices will go up. People will buy less. Other people will be out of work. And we don't want to see that happen.",Kasich,3/15/2016,Republican
"Trade, though, has to be balanced and we have to make sure that when we see a violation, like some country dumping their products into this country, believe me as president, I will stand up and I will shut down those imports because they're a violation of the agreement we have and the American worker expects us to stand up.",Kasich,3/15/2016,Republican
"Because nobody knows the system better than me. I know the H1B. I know the H2B. Nobody knows it better than me. I'm a businessman. These are laws. These are regulations. These are rules. We're allowed to do it. And frankly, because of the devaluations that other countries - the monetary devaluations that other countries are constantly doing and brilliantly doing against us, it's very, very hard for our companies in this country, in our country, to compete.",Trump,3/15/2016,Republican
"So I will take advantage of it; they're the laws. But I'm the one that knows how to change it. Nobody else on this dais knows how to change it like I do, believe me.",Trump,3/15/2016,Republican
"No, I support free trade deals that are good for America. We're 5 percent of the world's population. If all we do is sell things to each other, we can only sell to 5 percent of the people on earth. We have to have access to the hundreds of millions of people in the world today who can afford to buy things.",Rubio,3/15/2016,Republican
"The problem is we're a low-tariff country. To import something into the United States is not very expensive, but many of these countries we can't export to because their tariffs are too high. And so I am in favor of deals that allow us to bring down those tariffs so that America can sell things to all these people around the world.",Rubio,3/15/2016,Republican
"There are good trade deals and there are bad ones. So for example, here in Florida, we have benefited from the free trade deal with Colombia. It's allowed flower exporters to come into the United States but it's created jobs for hundreds of people who are now delivering those flowers and working in that industry. We have a surplus with Colombia.",Rubio,3/15/2016,Republican
"On the other hand, you've seen trade deals like in Mexico that have been less than promising in some aspects, better in others. Bottom line is I believe that America, if given access to foreign markets, our workers are the most productive in the world, our people are the most innovative on this planet. If it is a free and fair trade deal, we can compete against anyone in the world, and we need to in the 21st century.",Rubio,3/15/2016,Republican
"Actually that's incorrect. There are two different agreements. There's TPA and TPP. I opposed TPP and have always opposed TPP, which is what you asked about. And when it comes to trade, look, free trade, when we open up foreign markets, helps Americans. But we're getting killed in international trade right now. And we're getting killed because we have an administration that's doesn't look out for American workers and jobs are going overseas. We're driving jobs overseas.",Cruz,3/15/2016
"And the people who are losing out are in manufacturing jobs, or the steel industry or the auto industry. But I'll tell you who else is going to be losing out, which is the service industry. This Obama administration is negotiating the Trade in Services Agreement which is another treaty to allow services to come in and take jobs from Americans as well.",Cruz,3/15/2016,Republican
"And you've got to understand. Trade and immigration are interwoven, and they are hurting the working men and women of this country. So the question is, what's the solution? It's easy to talk about the problems. But do you have a solution to fix it? And I think the solution is several things.",Cruz,3/15/2016,Republican
"Number one, we need to negotiate trade deals protecting American workers first, not the corporate board room. Number two, we need to lift the regulations on American businesses here so we see jobs coming back. And number three, we need a tax plan like the tax plan I've introduced that will not tax exports and that will tax imports, and that will bring millions of high-paying jobs back to America.",Cruz,3/15/2016,Republican
"If it's being abused the way Disney did. Understand that program, it is illegal now under that program to use it to replace American workers. Under that program, you have to prove not only that you're not replacing Americans, but that you've tried to hire Americans. And if a company is caught abusing that process, they should never be allowed to use it again.",Rubio,3/15/2016,Republican
"The second problem with the current structure of the program that people perhaps don't understand is a lot of these companies are not directly hiring employees from abroad. They are hiring a consulting company like Tata, for example, out of India. That company then hoards up all of these visas. They hire workers. You hire - Disney or some other company hires this company.",Rubio,3/15/2016,Republican
"What they're basically doing is they are insourcing and outsourcing. They are bringing in workers from abroad that are not direct employees of a Disney or someone else, they're employees of this consulting business. And what I argue is that no consulting business such as that should be allowed to hoard up all of these visas, that the visas should only be available for companies to use to directly hire workers and that we should be stricter in how he enforce it.",Rubio,3/15/2016,Republican
"It is illegal now, it is a violation of the law now to use that program to replace Americans. And if a company is caught doing that, whether it be Disney or anyone else, they should be barred from using the program in the future.",Rubio,3/15/2016,Republican
"Well first, I think - well, I'd be open to it if it takes a pause. But I don't think it takes a pause to enforce the law. What they are doing is they are in fact using that program to replace an American.",Rubio,3/15/2016,Republican
"If there's an American working at Disney and they bring someone from another country using H1B to replace their direct job, that's in violation of the law. And what I'm explaining to you is, what they are doing now is they are not - what they are doing is they are eliminating the job.",Rubio,3/15/2016,Republican
"Well look, I believe in immigration, but it has to be controlled. The simple fact of the matter is I wouldn't be standing here. I'd be maybe running for president of Croatia if we didn't have immigration.",Kasich,3/15/2016,Republican
"Immigration is something that brings youth and vibrance and energy to our country. But we clearly have to control our borders. We can't have people just walking in. Look, we lock our doors at night in our homes. The country has to be able to lock its doors as well. So, we - I have a comprehensive plan to deal with this problem of immigration.",Kasich,3/15/2016,Republican
"I would say we have to absolutely finish the wall and guard the border. And if anybody were to come in after that, they are going to have to go back. No excuses because we can't continue this problem. I think we ought to have a guest worker program, where people come in, work and go home.",Kasich,3/15/2016,Republican
"And I think at the same time, for the 11 and a half million who are here, then in my view if they have not committed a crime since they've been here, they get a path to legalization. Not to citizenship. I believe that program can pass the Congress in the first 100 days.",Kasich,3/15/2016,Republican
"But let's not lose sight of the fact that the whole key to the future of America is strong economic growth with common sense regulation, lower taxes and a balanced budget.",Kasich,3/15/2016,Republican
"We can have a rising tide that lifts all the workers in America, all the people who are citizens of America, if we'll just follow the formula that works, that I used in Washington. And guess what, I've used it in Ohio to grow over 400 private sector jobs since I've been governor",Kasich,3/15/2016,Republican
"I will. First of all, I think and I know the H1B very well. And it's something that I frankly use and I shouldn't be allowed to use it. We shouldn't have it. Very, very bad for workers. And second of all, I think it's very important to say, well, I'm a businessman and I have to do what I have to do.",Trump,3/15/2016,Republican
"When it's sitting there waiting for you, but it's very bad. It's very bad for business in terms of - and it's very bad for our workers and it's unfair for our workers. And we should end it. Very importantly, the Disney workers endorsed me, as you probably read.",Trump,3/15/2016,Republican
"And I got a full endorsement because they are the ones that said, and they had a news conference, and they said, he's the only one that's going to be able to fix it. Because it is a mess. I think for a period of a year to two years we have to look back and we have to see, just to answer the second part of your question, where we are, where we stand, what's going on.",Trump,3/15/2016,Republican
"We have to sort of take a strong, good, hard look and come up with plans that work. And we're rushing into things, and we're just - we're leading with the chin.",Trump,3/15/2016,Republican
"We're leading with people that don't know what they are doing in terms of our leadership. I'd say a minimum of one year, maybe two years.",Trump,3/15/2016,Republican
"Well, we need to redefine our legal immigration system so that it meets the needs of the American economy. Right now, we're bringing in far too many low skilled workers. What that is doing is driving down the wages of hard-working Americans. Our system isn't working. And then on top of that, we've got a system that's allowing in millions of people to be here illegally.",Cruz,3/15/2016,Republican
"And the answer to that, I've laid out a very, very detailed immigration plan on my website. We're going to build a wall, triple the border patrol. We're going to end sanctuary cities. And let me tell you how we're going to do that.",Cruz,3/15/2016,Republican
"We're going to cut off federal taxpayer funds to any city that defies federal immigration laws.",Cruz,3/15/2016,Republican
