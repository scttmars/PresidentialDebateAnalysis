# PresidentialDebateAnalysis
 Intro/Problem Statement: Words are extremely powerful, especially when they are used over and over again to persuade the audience and ingrain the words into their memories. Our final project will analyze the debate speeches of Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump during the 2016 presidential race. The objective of the project aims at identifying what words and phrases were most common and looks into how both candidatesâ€™ word choices shaped the discussions during the debates. To take it a step further we analyzed how each candidate talks and gave the program data from other notable Democrats and Republicans to see if the program can find connections based on how these people speak.
